Implement Monte Carlo algorithm to get the value of π as we described in the class. Attached is one implementation of Monte Carlo algorithm to get the value of π. 
Write your own program as we studied in the class. Please submit your program, script file, and output.


Here are some notes from Notion

**Abstract:**

Given a circle and a square such that the square perfectly holds the circle or the circle perfectly fills the square, the ratio of a square with an area of 2x2 is given by 

$$
\frac{AreaOfCircle}{AreaOfSquare} = \frac{\pi^2}{2*2} = \frac{\pi}{4}
$$

Monte Carlo will choose some points within the square at random, where a score is kept to see how many points will be in the circle versus the parts of of the square that isn’t covered by the circle.

**Using interals:**

One quadrant of the square can be described by an intergral

Where the (x,y) coordinates are between 0 and 1. To tell if the point is within the circle, understand this:

Meaning if the sum of the squares of x and its respective y is less than or equal to 1, then it is within the circle, that is:

**Better Alternative:**

Choose random values of x to compute f(x) and sum the values of f(x), providing:

Where Xr is randomnly selected between X1 and X2

Question:

- The example integral in the slides doesn’t seem to match with the sequential code. Confused about the random selection of xr.
    - Answer: the more random points (xr) are selected withing that range, the higher accuracy of the area
