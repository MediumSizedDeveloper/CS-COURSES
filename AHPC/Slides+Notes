Class Notes

*************************PRAM Subclasses*************************

EREW (Exclusive Read, Exclusive Write) : Access to memory locations are exclusive. No concurrent read or write operations are allowed. That is the same memory address cannot be accessed (read/write) by multiple processors. Weakest, least flexible PRAM model.

CREW (Concurrent Read, Exclusive Write): Multiple read accesses to a memory location are allowed. Multiple write accesses to a memory location are serialized. That is this model allows multiple reads at the same time, but only 1 processor can write at time, however the sequential order of writes can be managed.

ERCW (Exclusive Read, Concurrent Write): Opposite of the previous, multiple write acesses to a memory location are allowed. Multiple read accesses to a memory location are *serialized*, that is the order of read requests can be handled. Can simulate an EREW PRAM .

CRCW (Concurrent Read, Concurrent Write): Allows multiple read and write accesses to a common memory location; Most powerful PRAM model; Can similate both EREW PRAM and CREW PRAM.

*************************Concurrent Write Access*************************
arbitrary PRAM: an arbitrary processor succeeds in writing into a cell when multiple processors write into that single shared memory cell.

common PRAM: processors must write the same value into the shared memory cell.

priority PRAM: the highest priority processor (either the smallest or largest indexed processor( succeeds in writing.

combining PRAM: if more than 1 processor writes to the same cell, the result written into it depends on the combining operator. i.e., *sum* operator will write the sum of the values, *maximum* will write the larger of the two
