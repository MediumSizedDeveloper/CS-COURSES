Recurrence Relations can be used to model many counting problems.

A recurrence relation is a recursivew formula that counts the number of ways to do a procedure involving n objects in terms of the number of ways to do the procedure with 
fewer than n objects.

There are 2 types of homogenous recurrence relations.

Vocab:
Homogeneous - having similar or uniform characteristics. vs Homogenous - an outdated biological term that refers to organs or body tissues with genetic similarities.

Type 1: 
Linear Homogeneous recurrence relations with constant coefficients.

                an = C1*an-1 + C2*an-2 + C3*an-3 + ... + Cr*an-r
                
- It is described as linear because all the terms have an exponent of 1, powers are not increasing
- It is Homogenous because every term has an ai, that is an-1, an-2, etc.
- It is const because C1,C2,...,Cr are constants

To solve Linear Homogeneous R.R. with constant coefficients, we must have 'r' initial conditions
  e.g., Fibonacci: an = an-1 + an-2, where a0=1, a1=1 ;= 1,1,2,3,5,8,13...

Type 2:
Inhomogeneous Recurrence Relations

                an = C*an-1 + f(n), where f(n) is just some function of n

- Inhomogeneous because one term has no ai, e.g., the function
